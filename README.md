# The Rouge Project token (RGE) and TGE contracts

Solidity smart contracts used before and during the Token Generation Event of the Rouge Project (June 2018).

3 ERC20 smart contracts/tokens :

   - RGEToken which is the main 'Rouge' token (symbol RGE) created during TGE and usable in the Rouge protocol
     (see repository https://github.com/TheRougeProject/Rouge-Protocol-ETH for the protocol itself)

   - RGXToken (RGX20, RGX15, ...) which is sold during pre-sale and gives a discount during the TGE (contribution is reusable)

   - RGXBonus (RGXB, RGXA) which is distributed before TGE and gives a discount during the TGE

And finally 1 smart contract handling the TGE itself.
